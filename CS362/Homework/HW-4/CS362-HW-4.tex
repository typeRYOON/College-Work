    \subsection{1 Report Information}
    \textbf{Title:} Lab Report for Lab 4: Photoresistor (LDR – Light Dependent Resistor)

    \textbf{Name/NetID:} Ryan Magdaleno, rmagd2

    \textbf{Lab Description:} The lab report outlines the creation of a circuit and 
    program utilizing a photoresistor and a 16x2 display. The display indicates the 
    relative amount of light in the room using five predefined text values: dark, 
    partially dark, medium, fully lit, and brightly lit. These values are shown on the 
    top line of the LCD display. The bottom line displays the number of milliseconds 
    since the Arduino was last reset, continuously updating without using the delay() 
    function. Determine the 5 light range values via testing.

    \vspace{-20pt}\subsection{3 Circuit Instructions}
    \vspace{-5pt}Here is a step by step guide on how to wire the circuit on the next page.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        To get started with wiring, get your Arduino board and breadboard situated next
        to each other.
        \item \vspace{-5pt}
        Connect a Arduino GND pin to the ground rail on your breadboard.
        \item \vspace{-5pt}
        Next connect your Arduino 5V power pin to the source rail on your breadboard.
        \item \vspace{-5pt}
        On your breadboard, place your photoresistor on two rails, connect one lead to 
        the source rail. Connect the other lead via the 10K$\Omega$ resistor to the
        ground rail. On the grounded lead rail, connect a wire from there to your
        Arduino's analog in A0 pin. This part sends a resistance value based on the
        light level.
        \item \vspace{-5pt}
        Place your 10K$\Omega$ Potentiometer on 3 rails, wire the outer rails to the 
        source and ground rails. \\The middle rail will be wired in a later step, this
        part controls the LCD's contrast.
        \item \vspace{-5pt}
        Place your 16x2 LCD on your breadboard and wire the connections like so: \\

    \vspace{-20pt}\subsection{8 Experimenting}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \vspace{-5pt}
        I determined the ranges by covering the photoresistor with my hands and read the
        lux value via the serial monitor, this was my "dark" values, $\approx$
        0 -- 15 lux.
        \item \vspace{-5pt}
        I then used a flashlight and checked documentation that the max lux value is
        1023, so I used 501 -- 2000 for my "brightly lit" values.
        \item \vspace{-5pt}
        Everything in between was done by moving my flashlight away and letting the
        photoresistor enter darkness, that's how I got my "partially dark", "medium",
        and "fully lit" ranges.

    \vspace{-20pt}\subsection{9 Conclusion}
    \vspace{-5pt}This was a fun lab, I learned how to use a photoresistor. My final
    project for this class might rely on resistors in case a part of my group's final
    project cannot be achieved. My final project uses solenoids to press keys on a
    keyboard, currently my groupmate is having trouble with the solenoid circuit. The 
    solenoid circuit caught on fire recently and we're looking for alternatives if
    the circuit can't be completed in time for our presentation. I thought of using
    photoresistors to detect the notes falling and sending the data via serial to a
    computer side program for virtual key presses. Writing this report in a how to
    manner also helped me fully understand the materials used in this lab.
