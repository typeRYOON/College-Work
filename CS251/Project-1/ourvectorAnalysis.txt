For this project, I used one vector to store the data that was needed to perform the plot and stats functions. For every state
I created a struct element within the vector. To sum I used 1 vector created on line 320 to store each state's struct data.
I stored the data for the districts numbers/votes by storing everything after the state name into a string like so:
1,xx,2xx,..,53,xx,xx. I read the string when I needed to for a specific state.

There were 50 elements inserted because there were 50 states in the districts.txt dataset. For each struct element I stored
the state name, the data string that contains the district num and voting numbers, and I also stored the total district
number and eligible voters count as well.

For the number of elements accessed I had to sort the array based on the state name due to binary search (for search/plot/stats functions)
needing a sorted array to correctly find the desired key. I used insertion sort which is on average a O(N^2) runtime sorting algorithm.
There were 50 elements, and so I expected around 2500 element accesses due to its quadratic runtime (50^2 = 2500). There are also maybe
another 10 times when I need to access the elements such as using binary search and returning the index of the state struct needed for
the plot and stats functions to only have one access each. There is only one sort done during the loading function. Overall for amount
of elements and insertion sort being used, 2373 element accesses is within my expectations for this specific dataset.

A method to reduce the number of accesses would be to use a more efficient sorting algorithm like a O(NlogN) one.
I used insertion sort for this project as a complex sorting algorithm was not the point of this project but definitely
could be a point that could be improved upon if I wanted this program to run more efficiently.
