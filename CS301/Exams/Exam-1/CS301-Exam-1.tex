\textbf{Problem 1: Multiple Choice}

\vspace{5px}\textbf{Solution ::} 
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Which of the following constraints exists for the transition function in an NFA
5-tuple. \\
$\delta : Q\times (\Sigma\cup\epsilon)\longrightarrow P(Q)$.
\item Given that $A$ and $B$ are regular languages, which of the following are
not regular. \\ $A^nB^n$.
\item Which of the following languages is finite? \\
$L_b = \{w\in\{0,1\}^* : |w|\le 20\}$.
\item From the pumping lemma, any string $s$ with more than $p$ characters can
be partitioned into $xyz$. Identify the property of $x,y,z$ below which is true. \\
$z$ must be a suffix of $s$.
\item For a given DFA $M$, which of the following can be infinite? \\
The language it decides.
\item All finite languages are regular. \\ True.
\item Which of the following is a base case for the recursive structure of regular
expressions? \\ $\emptyset$ : The empty set.
\item Which of the following languages are not regular? \\
$L_a = \{w\in\{0,1\}^* : w\text{ has at least three zeros for every one}\}$.

\textbf{Problem 2: Short Answer}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item
Give an example of an infinitely large binary language. \\
\vspace{5px}\textbf{Solution ::}
$$L=(01)^*$$

\line(1,0){343px}

\item
Given an NFAs $M_A, M_B$ which decide $L_A, L_B$ respectively, describe how
to generate an NFA which decides their concatenation, $L_AL_B$. \\
\vspace{5px}\textbf{Solution ::} \\
Given $M_A$ and $M_B$ we can make the concatenation $L_AL_B$ by adding
epsilons from the final states of NFA $M_A$ to the start state of NFA $M_B$.
We must then make the start state of $M_B$. We must then make the start state
of $M_B$ become a normal state, the final states of $M_A$ normal.
\begin{align*}
    L(L_A)\circ L(L_B) &= \{xy \,|\, x\in L(L_A) \cap y\in L(L_B)\} \\
    Q &= \{Q_A\cup Q_B\} \\
    \Sigma &= \Sigma_A = \Sigma_B \\
    q_0 &= q_{0_A} \\
    F &= \{F_B\} \\
    \delta &= \delta_A\cup\delta_B\cup(F_A,\epsilon\longrightarrow q_{0_B})
\end{align*}
\line(1,0){343px}

\item
Give the 5-tuple for a DFA which accepts the empty language. \\
Let $\Sigma = \{0, 1\}$ \\
\vspace{5px}\textbf{Solution ::}
\begin{align*}
    Q &= \{q_0\} \\
    \Sigma &= \{0, 1\} \\
    q_0 &= q_0 \\
    F &= \emptyset \\
    \delta &= \{(q_0, 0)\longrightarrow q_0 \,|\, (q_0, 1)\longrightarrow q_0\}

\textbf{Problem 6: Non-Context-Free Proof} \\
Prove that the following language $L$ is irregular.
$$L = \{w\in\Sigma^* : w \text{ contains more 0's than 1's}\}$$
\vspace{5px}\textbf{Solution ::}

Let's assum $L$ is regular for the sake of contradiction. There must be some
DFA that decides $L$. Therefore there is a pumping length $p$.

Let $s = 1^p0^{p+1}$, $s$ can be partitioned into $xy^iz, i\ge 0$. \\
$x$ must be $1^\alpha$, $0\le\alpha\le p-\beta$. \\
$y$ must be $1^{i\beta}$, $1\le\beta < p - \alpha$. \\
$xy$ is within $p$. $\alpha + \beta\le p$.

If we pick $i=2$ we get the form $xyyz$ which is $\in L$. Therefore we get:
$$1^\alpha1^\beta1^{p-\beta-\alpha}0^{p+1} = 1^{p+\beta}0^{p+1}$$
However, we get the contradiction $p+\beta\ge p+1$. The original regular
language condition was that there were more 0s than 1s but because
$\beta$ must always be $\ge 1$ they will always be at least equal.

$\therefore L$ is not regular.
