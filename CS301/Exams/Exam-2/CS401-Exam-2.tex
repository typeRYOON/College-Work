\textbf{Problem 6. Non-Context-Free Proof} \\
Prove that the following language $L$ is not context-free.
$$L=\{0^i1^j2^i\,|\,j<i\}$$
\vspace{5px}\textbf{Solution ::}

Suppose for the sake of contradiction, that $L$ is context-free. Then, by \\definition,
there must be a CFG $G$ with pumping length $p$ that generates it. \\
Let $s = 0^{p+1}1^p2^{p+1}$ \\
By the pumping length, $s$ can be partitioned into $u,v,x,y,z$ such that
$|vxy|\le p$ and $|vy| \ge 1$. We proceed on cases for $v$ and $y$:
\begin{enumerate}[\hspace{5px}-]
\item 
$v/y$ are contained within the 1s. If we were to set $vxy$ to $k$ 1s for some
$k \ge 1$ such that $|vxy|\le p$. By the pumping lemma if we pump up let's
say $i=10$, we would generate $\ge 10$ 1s which makes our total 1s atleast
$p+10$ which makes our inequality $j<i$ false. This new string is $\notin L$,
a contradiction.

\item
$v/y$ are contained within only the 0s or 2s. If we were to set $vxy$ to $k$ 0s
(or 2s), for some $k\ge 1$ such that $|vxy|\le p$. By the pumping lemma if we
pump up or down i, i.e. $i\neq 1$, $i\ge 0$, the \# of 0s would not match
the $p+1$ 2s or vice versa. Similarily this occurs when $vxy$ is contained
within 0s and 1s or 1s and 2s, a contradiction.
\end{enumerate}
All cases result in a contradiction of the pumping lemma. \\
$\therefore L$ is not context-free.
